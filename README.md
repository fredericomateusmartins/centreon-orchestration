# Centreon Orchestration
Centreon Environment Orchestration

## Synopsis

The `centreon-orchestration` is intended to be used as a monitoring orchestrator, for easability in adding and editing Centreon objects.

The `.ini` file consists of sections for each Centreon object, with parameters in each section for the API.

The program requires an `.ini` file as argument, in order to create or edit objects as needed.

```shell
centreon-orchestration --ini playbooks/hostname.ini --user username
```

There can also be generated a default `.ini` file:

```shell
centreon-orchestration --ini playbooks/new_hostname.ini --generate-ini
```

Or generate a `.ini` file based on a host current configuration:

```shell
centreon-orchestration --ini playbooks/clone_hostname.ini --user username --generate-ini --host hostname
```

Every parameter is optional inside the file sections, except it's '[name]' and 'type'. All values will be fetch in the default section.<br>
_If there's no default section, or it is commented out, the default values are set by the program._<br>
_The sections are parsed with the following order `command` > `hostgroup` > `service` > `host` > `resource` > `poller` regardless of their position in the file._
_If another type is given, other than the one's previously shown, it will be ignored by the parser._

```shell
[machine_hostname]
type = host
action = add
alias = New Host Description
ip = 10.1.20.1
template = centreon_host_template
group = linux-servers|hostgroupname_test
resource = resource_name
poller = poller_name
snmp_community = community_string
snmp_version = snmp_version

[hostgroupname_test]
type = hostgroup
action = add
alias = New Test Hostgroup
resource = resource_name

[check_ping_test]
type = command
action = add
line = $USER1$/check_ping -H $HOSTADDRESS$ -w 3000.0,80% -c 5000.0,100% -p 1

[servicename_test]
type = service
action = add
alias = New Test Service
group = hostgroupname_test
template = resource_name
check_command = check_ping_test

[resource_name]
type = resource
action = reload

[poller_name]
type = poller
action = restart
```
